Creating the Cinema Database
      Answer: CREATE DATABASE CinemaDB;
Create Tables and Deciding Datatypes
MOVIE: CREATE TABLE MOVIE (
                    MovieName varchar (50) not null,
Description varchar(255) not null,
CONSTRAINT PK_MOVIE_MID PRIMARY KEY (MovieName)
)

                  TheaterName varchar (35) not null, 
                 Address varchar (255) not null,
                 City varchar (12) ,
                 Phone char (10),
                 DistanceToCenterOfSeattle varchar (12),
                 CONSTRAINT PK_THEATER_TID PRIMARY KEY (TheaterName)
       )

                s_id smallint (5) unsigned not null,
                MN varchar(50) not null,
                TN varchar(35) not null,
                DayOfWeek varchar(9),

                ShowTime time,
                CONSTRAINT PK_SHOW_TIME PRIMARY KEY (s_id),

Add Zip_Code column to Theater Table
     First you start with: ALTER TABLE THEATER
                                     ADD Zip_Code char (5);
     Next:  
      update Theater set Zip_code = '77002' where Theater_Name = 'Wortham Theatre';
      update Theater set Zip_code = '25688' where Theater_Name = 'AMC Miami 15';
      update Theater set Zip_code = '93845' where Theater_Name = AMC Theater Odessa';
      update Theater set Zip_code = '87815' where Theater_Name = 'Hawkins Southfield 18';
update Theater set Zip_code = '68971' where Theater_Name = 'Moon Plaza Twin Theaters Pasadena';

Bonus: Define new surrogate primary key attributes.
ALTER TABLE Show_Time
DROP constraint Show_TimeFK_MID foreign key (MN) references Movie(MovieName),
DROP constraint Show_TimeFK_TID foreign key (TN) references Theater(TheaterName)
ADD constraint Show_TimeFK_MID foreign key (MN) references Movie(MovieID),
ADD constraint Show_TimeFK_TID foreign key (TN) references Theater(TheaterID)

ALTER TABLE Theater
DROP constraint TheaterPK_TID primary key (TheaterName)
ADD Theater_ID smallint(5) unsigned not null
ADD constraint TheaterPK_TID primary key (TheaterID)

ALTER TABLE Movie
Drop constraint MoviePK_MID primary key (MovieName)
ADD Movie_ID smallint(5) unsigned not null
ADD constraint MoviePK_MID primary key (MovieID)
UPDATE Theater set TheaterID = ‘1’ where TheaterName = 'Wortham Theater';
